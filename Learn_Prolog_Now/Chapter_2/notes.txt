Two terms unify if they are equal or if the variables can be instantiated so that they are equal.
Two complex terms will unify if they have the same functor and arity and if the corresponding terms can be unified.

We can check if two terms can be unified with the =/2 predicate.

Prolog backtracks when given a query to try and find a unification in a tree search like manner.
