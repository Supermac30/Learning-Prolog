There are only three basic constructs in prolog:
facts, rules, and queries

A knowledge base is a collection of rules and facts.

Variables start with uppercase letters or underscores, semicolons mean or
colons mean and.

A deduction is called a Modus Ponens

We can query ?- type(Variable) and prolog will return
an example of an object that satisfies the type. Typing
; will return another answer.

Atoms are strings essentially.
functors are used to refer to atoms at the start of a line,
e.g. type(a, b). has the functor type/2
The arity of a functor is how many arguments it accepts which is appended to the end of its name.
Predicates with different aritys are treated as different functors.
